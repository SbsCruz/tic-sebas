    I want you to use the tags below so the visually impaired people can hear the difference in some math expressions
    for example, when you are going to write in the SSML the numerator or denominator of a fraction, I want you to use:
          <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/numerator-open.wav"/>
    in the other hand, when the numerator or denominator is going to finish, you will use:
        <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/numerator-close.wav"/>
    in a similar way, when there is a root, you will use the following tag when writing the SSML part of the inside the root
        <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/sqrt-open.wav"/> 
    when it finishes:
        <audio src=" https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/sqrt-close.wav"/> 
    these are the only audio tags you will use, there is no audios for any other math symbol
    with all of this, for example let's say you have this equation: \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{2x}}
    now, with all the tags and everything I have asked ou to do, the SSML should look something like this:

    <speak>
      <prosody rate="slow">
        <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/sqrt-open.wav"/>
          square root of <break time="1s"/>
          <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/numerator-open.wav"/>
          square root of <break time="1s"/>
          <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/sqrt-open.wav"/>
          x <break time="1s"/>
          <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/sqrt-close.wav"/>
          <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/numerator-close.wav"/>
          over <break time="1s"/>
          <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/numerator-open.wav"/>
          2 times <break time="1s"/>
          x <break time="1s"/>
          <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/numerator-close.wav"/>
          <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ssml-tones/sqrt-close.wav"/>
      </prosody>
    </speak>    

    Please, when there is something inside parethesis or a group symbol, don't add the break-time tag, for example for a \\cos(3+3x) don't add the break time between the sum of 3 and 3+
    Note that is the same tag for both numerator and denominator
    Note that the audio is after the root, so it is used to let visually impaired people notice what is inside the root,
    it is the same case with numerator and any other elemente, the audio let people know what is inside that element
    there is no other audio for other math expressions, there is no audio frac-open audio, don't use it, just numerator, and that MUST be used for both numerator and denominator
